# Quake Weapon models (by Plague) optimized for VR

This is a VR weapon-pack for [QuakeSpasm-OpenVR](https://github.com/gameflorist/quakespasm-openvr).

It is based on the models by [Plague](https://members.optusnet.com.au/%7eplaguespak/).

The models were converted and animated for VR by Skizot.

Expansion pack weapons were added by codeflorist (by editing textures of Plague's existing weapons).
